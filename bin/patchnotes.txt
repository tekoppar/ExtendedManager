AlphaBeta v.0.1.5
- Patch 1.3.1 support.
- Controller input was fixed, then I broke it for the trainer again.
- Races now store the worlds uberstate when you start one, so if anything changes with a race that reverts to how the world was before you started a race.

AlphaBeta v.0.1.4
- Patch 1.3 support
- Backupsaves manager, allows you to save to a specific backup slot or create a new if if you have less then 10.

AlphaBeta v.0.1.3
- Uber state recorder, now allows you to record the uberstates that you want associated with a race. Setup the world to the state you want and open the race editor and click on "Save Uberstates". These will then be loaded whenever a race is ran. *WARNING* Currently it does not save the existing worlds uberstate and restores it upon exiting a race or closing the manager. So don't use a file you care about when using the race editor. This will be fixed in 0.1.5, but I didn't want to struggle with any errors it would create with releasing a working version for patch 1.3. *WARNING*

AlphaBeta v.0.1.2
- ???

AlphaBeta v.0.1.1
- Stability fixes
- Updated race editor UI
- Auto updater

AlphaBeta v.0.1.0 - Race Edition
- Race Editor, allows you to create reaces and edit their settings
- Fixed the piped from single shared too using two, one for the manger and one for the dll. Should improve stability and speed greatly
- Hitbox Split editor that allows you to see the rectangle in game, making it easier to create hitbox splits

AlphaBeta v.0.9
- Accurate game completion, this is gotten from the same method Moon uses it's just not rounded
- Framestepping, thank hitachihex for this one. This one might be a bit buggy at the moment but by pressing F5 you start framestepping and pressing F5 again you frame step one frame, F6 stops framestepping.
- Context menu no longer closes when you click on an item.
- Create checkpoint, kinda pointless if you're using debug. It does not create an actual checkpoint but a save like the debug save option.
- Code cleanup to make things easier, didn't fix as much as I wanted.
